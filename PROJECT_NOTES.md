April 2026: Rasterizer Edge-Function Signedness Bug
---------------------------------------------------

Summary
-------
We found a major RTL bug in the quad rasterizer that made the renderer look
"2.5D" even when the camera math was mostly correct. The most visible symptoms
were:

  * top faces appearing too large when the camera looked down on blocks
  * shared top/side boundaries shifting as the camera rotated
  * slanted quads in the screen-space edge test collapsing toward their
    bounding boxes instead of keeping clean diagonal edges
  * only some edges of a quad appearing to clip correctly

Root Cause
----------
The bug was in `hw/voxel_gpu.sv` inside the edge-function evaluation logic.
The older code formed the constant term with a manual concatenation:

    {{32{edge_C[i][31]}}, edge_C[i]}

Even though that expression visually looks like a sign extension, the
concatenation operator itself is an unsigned expression. In practice, that
allowed the larger edge-function expression to be evaluated incorrectly for
negative coefficients.

This was especially damaging because the rasterizer's inclusion test is:

    edge_eval >= 0

If an edge coefficient that should be negative gets treated as a huge positive
value, that edge stops clipping the quad properly and the rasterizer fills too
much of the bounding box.

We confirmed the issue with a small Verilator repro. For one negative test case,
the old-style expression produced:

    429496726593

while the correct signed result was:

    -3007

That mismatch exactly matches the observed hardware behavior: quads whose
negative edge terms should have excluded pixels instead admitted them instead.

Fix
---
We rewrote the edge-function path so the full expression stays explicitly in
signed 64-bit arithmetic. The current implementation in `hw/voxel_gpu.sv`
creates signed intermediate wires for:

  * `edge_A[i] * draw_x_s`
  * `edge_B[i] * draw_y_s`
  * the sign-extended `edge_C[i]`

and then sums those signed intermediate terms.

This avoids mixed signed/unsigned coercion inside a single inline expression and
makes the intent obvious to both simulation tools and Quartus synthesis.

Why This Mattered Visually
--------------------------
This bug explained several confusing rendering symptoms that initially looked
like projection or camera-transform errors:

  * top faces warping as the camera yaw changed
  * a column's top appearing to grow too large from certain angles
  * neighboring faces stealing area from each other
  * screen-space quads in the edge test looking correct on one side but boxy on
    the others

Because the rasterizer was not respecting all four edges consistently, the
monitor output looked like perspective math was broken even though the deeper
issue was actually in coverage testing inside the RTL.

Validation
----------
We validated the fix with three levels of testing:

  1. A direct Verilator repro for the signed/unsigned edge expression.
  2. `sw/tests/renderer_edge_test`, which submits hand-placed screen-space
     quads with strong diagonal edges.
  3. The real block-scene renderer and interactive game camera.

Before the fix, the edge test produced quads that visibly collapsed toward their
bounding boxes and shared edges were wrong. After the fix, the edge ownership
behavior matched the intended geometry and the scene stopped exhibiting the same
top-face growth and edge warping.

Good Report Wording
-------------------
Suggested writeup text for the final report:

  We diagnosed a rasterizer bug caused by signed/unsigned coercion in the
  SystemVerilog edge-function evaluation path. Negative edge coefficients were
  not preserved correctly in the original expression, so some edges failed to
  reject pixels and the rasterizer overfilled the quad bounding box. Visually,
  this made top faces appear too large, caused shared edges to shift during
  camera rotation, and made the renderer look geometrically incorrect even when
  the camera transform was mostly sound. We fixed the issue by keeping the full
  edge equation in explicit signed 64-bit arithmetic and validated the result
  with both synthetic screen-space tests and the full block-scene renderer.

Engineering Takeaway
--------------------
For arithmetic-heavy RTL, especially rasterizers, do not rely on implicit
signedness through large inline expressions. Use explicitly signed intermediate
wires for each term of the equation, then combine them in a final signed add.
